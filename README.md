# Embedded_Motor_Control

This a DC Motor control with embedded system using C programming. The generated velocity porfile is a trapezoidal shape and then a PID control is implemented to control the speed of the motor to maintain an acceptable error while it is spinning.
The model of the chip is MicroChip PIC16F73.
